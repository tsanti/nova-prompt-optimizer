My name is [Sender], and I have been utilizing ProCare Facility Solutions for the maintenance and management of my commercial property for the past few years. Your services have always been reliable and efficient, which is why I am reaching out to you today.\n\nI am writing to request assistance with a specialized cleaning service for our office building. We have recently undergone some renovations, and there is a significant amount of dust and debris that needs to be addressed. Additionally, the carpets and windows require a thorough cleaning to restore them to their original condition.\n\nI have already scheduled a routine cleaning, but I believe this situation requires more specialized attention. Given the nature of the work needed, I would appreciate it if you could arrange for a team that specializes in deep cleaning and post-renovation cleanup.\n\nCould you please provide me with the available dates and any additional information required to proceed with this request? Your prompt assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated, as we aim to have the office fully operational and presentable as soon as possible.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Sender]]\n- \"urgency\" as one of `high`, `medium`, `low`\n- \"sentiment\" as one of `negative`, `neutral`, `positive`\n- \"categories\" as a dictionary with categories as keys and boolean values indicating if the category matches the input.
