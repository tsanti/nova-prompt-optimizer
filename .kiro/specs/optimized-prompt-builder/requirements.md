# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Optimized Prompt Builder is a web-based interface that extends the existing Nova Prompt Optimizer frontend to enable subject matter experts and non-technical users to create high-quality prompts following Nova best practices. This feature will provide an intuitive, guided experience that leverages the Nova Prompt Optimizer SDK and its DSPy backend to automatically apply optimization techniques, prompt structuring, and Nova-specific best practices without requiring technical knowledge.

The system will build upon the existing FastHTML frontend architecture, adding new components and workflows that guide users through declarative prompt creation. It will integrate with the current database schema, optimization workflows, and AI-powered features while providing abstractions that make prompt optimization accessible to domain experts, content creators, and business users who understand their use cases but may not have technical backgrounds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I describe what I want the AI to do THEN the system SHALL automatically format it according to Nova's task definition patterns
2. WHEN I provide background information about my domain THEN the system SHALL structure it using Nova's context organization principles
3. WHEN I specify how the AI should behave THEN the system SHALL apply Nova's instruction clarity and specificity guidelines
4. WHEN I describe the desired output format THEN the system SHALL format requirements according to Nova's response formatting standards
5. WHEN I provide sample inputs and outputs THEN the system SHALL integrate them using appropriate few-shot learning patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to automatically optimize my prompts, so that they perform optimally with Nova models without me needing to understand the technical optimization process.

5. WHEN no training data is provided THEN the system SHALL still apply meta-prompting optimization and suggest generating sample data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want to provide examples of good and bad outputs, so that the system can learn what constitutes quality in my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a dataset file THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the format and structure
2. WHEN I don't have training data THEN the system SHALL offer to generate realistic examples based on my use case description
3. WHEN I describe what makes a good response THEN the system SHALL create appropriate evaluation metrics automatically
4. WHEN I provide examples of correct outputs THEN the system SHALL use them to improve prompt performance
5. WHEN optimization runs THEN the system SHALL show how well the prompt performs on my specific criteria

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business user, I want simple controls for optimization quality and speed, so that I can balance performance with time and cost constraints without understanding technical parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select optimization quality (Fast, Balanced, Best) THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate model and parameter settings
2. WHEN I choose optimization speed preferences THEN the system SHALL adjust processing intensity accordingly
3. WHEN I have budget constraints THEN the system SHALL provide cost estimates and optimization options
4. WHEN I need results quickly THEN the system SHALL offer faster optimization modes with clear trade-off explanations
5. WHEN optimization runs THEN the system SHALL provide clear progress updates and estimated completion times

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to start with existing prompts or templates, so that I can improve what I already have rather than starting from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I paste existing prompt text THEN the system SHALL analyze and suggest improvements while preserving my intent
2. WHEN I use placeholder variables (like {customer_name}) THEN the system SHALL maintain them throughout the process
3. WHEN I select from prompt templates THEN the system SHALL customize them for my specific use case
4. WHEN I provide example conversations THEN the system SHALL learn from them to improve the prompt
5. WHEN I export my optimized prompt THEN the system SHALL provide it in formats I can easily use (text, JSON, API-ready)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a non-technical user, I want clear guidance when something goes wrong, so that I can understand what happened and how to fix it without needing technical support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make a mistake in the interface THEN the system SHALL show helpful error messages in plain language
2. WHEN required information is missing THEN the system SHALL clearly highlight what I need to provide
3. WHEN optimization fails THEN the system SHALL explain what went wrong and suggest next steps
4. WHEN there are connectivity issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on how to resolve them
5. WHEN the system is busy THEN the system SHALL explain wait times and provide alternatives

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to test and preview my prompt before optimization, so that I can ensure it will work correctly for my use case before investing time in optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete the prompt builder steps THEN the system SHALL show a preview of how the prompt will behave
2. WHEN I test the prompt with sample inputs THEN the system SHALL show example outputs before optimization
3. WHEN I review my configuration THEN the system SHALL provide a clear summary of all settings and choices
4. WHEN I want to estimate costs THEN the system SHALL show approximate time and resource requirements
5. WHEN I'm ready to optimize THEN the system SHALL provide a final confirmation with all details clearly displayed

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a subject matter expert, I want to collaborate with others on prompt development, so that we can combine domain knowledge and iterate on prompts as a team.

#### Acceptance Criteria
