# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a web-based frontend for the Nova Prompt Optimizer using FastAPI backend and React frontend. The frontend will provide the same functionality currently available in the Jupyter notebook samples, making prompt optimization accessible through a modern web interface without modifying the existing backend adapters.

The system will allow users to upload datasets, create and edit prompts, configure custom metrics, run optimizations, and visualize results through an intuitive web interface that mirrors the workflow demonstrated in the `/samples` repository.

5. WHEN a user exports results THEN the system SHALL provide options to download results as JSON, CSV, or formatted reports
6. IF results contain errors THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate failed predictions and their error messages
7. WHEN a user reviews optimization history THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and sorting options by date, performance, or configuration

### Requirement 6: System Integration and Performance
